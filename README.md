## What Is Autobrr?

What is autobrr, and how does it fit into the ecosystem?

We can start by talking about torrent trackers (hereby referred to as indexers) and maintaining ratio. You are required
to maintain a ratio with most indexers. Ratio is built by seeding your torrents. The earlier you're seeding a torrent,
the more peers you make yourself available to on that torrent.

Software like Radarr and Sonarr utilizes RSS to look for new torrents. RSS feeds are updated regularly, but too slow to
let you be a part of what we call the initial swarm of a torrent. This is where autobrr comes into play.

Many indexers announce new torrents on their IRC channels the second it is uploaded to the site. autobrr monitors such
channels in real time and grabs the torrent file as soon as it's uploaded based on certain conditions (hereby referred
to as filters) that you set up within autobrr. It then sends that torrent file to a download client of your choice via
an action set within the filter. A download client can be anything from qBittorrent and Deluge, to Radarr and Sonarr, or
a watch folder.

When your autobrr filter is set to send the torrent files to Radarr and Sonarr, they will decide if it's something they
want, and then forward it to the torrent client they are set up with.

autobrr can also send matches (torrent files that meets your filter's criteria) directly to torrent clients like
qBittorrent, Deluge, r(u)Torrent and Transmission. You don't need to use the *arr suite to make use of autobrr.

## Key Features

- Torrents and Usenet support
- Support for 75+ torrent trackers with IRC announces
- Newznab, Torznab and RSS support to easily get access to hundreds of torrent and Usenet indexers
- Torrent Magnet support
- Powerful but simple filtering with RegEx support (like in autodl-irssi)
- Easy to use and mobile friendly web UI (with dark mode!) to manage everything
- Built on Go and React making autobrr lightweight and perfect for supporting multiple platforms (Linux, FreeBSD,
  Windows, macOS) on different architectures (e.g. x86, ARM)
- Great container support (Docker, k8s/Kubernetes)
- Database engine supporting both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Notifications (Discord, Telegram, Notifiarr, Pushover, Gotify)
- One autobrr instance can communicate with multiple clients (torrent, Usenet and \*arr) on remote servers
- Base path / Subfolder (and subdomain) support for convenient reverse-proxy support

### Available Download Clients and Actions

- **qBittorrent:** Includes built-in re-announce, categories, rules, max active downloads, etc.
- **Deluge v1+ and v2+**
- **rTorrent**
- **Transmission**
- **Porla**
- **Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Whisparr, Readarr:** Pushes releases directly for early swarm participation, rather than relying on RSS feeds.
- **SABnzbd (Usenet):** Integrates smoothly for Usenet downloads.
- **Watch Folder:** Monitors specified folders for new files.
- **Exec Custom Scripts:** Execute tailored scripts for advanced automation.
- **Webhook:** Offers webhook support for diverse integration needs.

### RSS and Usenet Support

A lot of indexers do not announce new torrents in an IRC channel. You can still make use of these indexers with autobrr
since it has built in support for feeds as well. Both Torznab, Newznab and regular RSS is supported. RSS indexers are treated the same way as regular indexers within autobrr.

Usenet support via Newznab feeds allows you to easily manage everything in a single application. While there is a lot of
applications that handles RSS well, we think autobrr offers very easy to use filtering to help you get the content you
want.

You can use Usenet feeds and send to arrs or send directly to SABnzbd.

```

For more info check
the [docs](https://quickbox.io/knowledge-base/v3/applications-v3/autobrr-applications-v3/autobrr-quick-reference/)

### Shared Seedbox

#### One-Click Installer & Quick Installer

- HostingByDesign (former Seedbox.io) via box - `box install autobrr`
- Swizzin.net via box - `box install autobrr`
- Seedit4.me
- SeedHost.eu
- Ultra.cc

##### Installation Scripts

We have support for a couple of other providers out of the box.  
Please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WQ2eUycxyT) if your provider is missing.
The scripts require some input, but do most of the work.

#### WhatBox

```bash
wget https://gobrr.sh/install_whatbox && bash install_whatbox
```

#### Feralhosting

```bash
wget https://gobrr.sh/install_feral && bash install_feral
```

#### Bytesized Hosting

```bash
wget https://gobrr.sh/install_bytesized && bash install_bytesized
```

#### Other providers

For other providers the Seedbox.io installer should work. If not, open an issue or contact us
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WQ2eUycxyT)

```bash
wget https://gobrr.sh/install_sbio && bash install_sbio
```

### Docker Compose

Modify accordingly if running with unRAID or setting up with Portainer.

- Logging is optional
- Host port mapping might need to be changed to not collide with other apps
- Change `BASE_DOCKER_DATA_PATH` to match your setup. Can be simply `./data`
- Set custom network if needed

Create `docker-compose.yml` and add the following. If you have an existing setup change to fit that.

```yml
version: "3.7"

services:
  autobrr:
    container_name: autobrr
    image: ghcr.io/autobrr/autobrr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ}
    user: 1000:1000
    volumes:
      - ${BASE_DOCKER_DATA_PATH}/autobrr/config:/config
    ports:
      - 7474:7474
```

Then start with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Distroless Docker Images

> [!CAUTION]
> This image comes without a shell, and external filtering and actions relying on `exec` will therefore not work with anything but compiled static binaries.
> 
> To clarify: **`BASH` and `SH` shell scripts WILL NOT WORK!**
>
> Use the standard image if you rely on this functionality.

For users who prioritize container security, one of the longterm maintainers offer alternative Docker images built on [Distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless). Specifically the `distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` base image.

Distroless images do not contain a package manager or shell, thereby reducing the potential attack surface and making them a more secure option. These stripped-back images contain only the application and its runtime dependencies.

The repository for these builds can be found here: [https://github.com/s0up4200/autobrr-distroless](https://github.com/s0up4200/autobrr-distroless)

### Windows

Check the Windows Setup Guide [here](https://autobrr.com/installation/windows).

### MacOS

#### Install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Install autobrr

```bash
brew install autobrr
```

#### Run

```bash
brew services start autobrr
```

### Linux Generic

Download the latest release, or download the [source code](https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr/releases/latest) and build
it yourself using `make build`.

```bash
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/autobrr/autobrr/releases/latest | grep download | grep linux_x86_64 | cut -d\" -f4)
```

#### Unpack

Run with `root` or `sudo`. If you do not have root, or are on a shared system, place the binaries somewhere in your home directory like `~/.bin`.

```bash
tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf autobrr*.tar.gz
```

This will extract both `autobrr` and `autobrrctl` to `/usr/local/bin`.
Note: If the command fails, prefix it with `sudo` and re-run again.

#### Systemd (Recommended)

On Linux-based systems, it is recommended to run autobrr as a sort of service with auto-restarting capabilities, in
order to account for potential downtime. The most common way is to do it via systemd.

You will need to create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/` called `autobrr.service`.

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/autobrr@.service
```

Then place the following content inside the file (e.g. via nano/vim/ed):

```systemd title="/etc/systemd/system/autobrr@.service"
[Unit]
Description=autobrr service for %i
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
Group=%i
ExecStart=/usr/bin/autobrr --config=/home/%i/.config/autobrr/

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service. Enable will make it startup on reboot.

```bash
systemctl enable -q --now --user autobrr@$USER
```

By default, the configuration is set to listen on `127.0.0.1`. While autobrr works fine as is exposed to the internet,
it is recommended to use a reverse proxy
like [nginx](https://autobrr.com/installation/linux#nginx), [caddy](https://autobrr.com/installation/linux#caddy)
or [traefik](https://autobrr.com/installation/docker#traefik).

If you are not running a reverse proxy change `host` in the `config.toml` to `0.0.0.0`.
